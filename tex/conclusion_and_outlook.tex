\begin{frame}{General statistics}
\uncover<+->{For this work:\\~\\}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
	\item 3600 signals for 10 different physics were simulated.\\~\\
	\item 6 different noise amplitudes were added.\\~\\
	\item Tens of embedding dimensions and time delays were tested.\\~\\
	\item Tens of topological vectorization and amplitude measures were tested.\\~\\
	\item A 10 dimensional feature vector was selected.\\~\\
	\item A 90\% classification accuracy was achieved.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Innovations}
\uncover<+->{Three important innovations were made in this research:\\~\\}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
	\item A code was written to calculate a spectral energy density using the semi-analytical formula; which is expandable to other astrophysical, cosmological and dynamical scenarios.\\~\\
	\item A number of functions and a data structure were added to the \textit{LALSuite} package which enable it to simulate a SGWB from a custom $\Omega_{SGWB}$.\\~\\
	\item A novel topological measure was introduced which can classify different SGWBs based on their physical parameters.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Suggestions}
\uncover<+->{In the future we can expand on this research by doing:\\~\\}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
	\item A Fischer forcast to evaluate the detection probability of PBH-induced SGWBs via different ovservatories.\\~\\
	\item Comparing our classification results with the results from more classical algorithms.\\~\\
	\item Considering other PBH formation scenarios and simulating their SGWBs.\\~\\
	\item Changing various astrophysical and cosmological parameters to investigate our models ability to constrain those parameters.
\end{itemize}
